# emulator

This is an early work-in-progress GameBoy emulator written in Java SE using the standard library exclusively (with the exception of JUnit for testing).

It conforms to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), as enforced by Checkstyle.

FindBugs is used for static analysis.

A testing framework has been created using JUnit, with complete code coverage as a goal.
